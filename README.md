Benchmarks for meta-heuristic optimization algorithms

## Meta-heuristic algorithms
* Intensification: <br/> 
 &nbsp; The ability of improving the existing solutions by exploiting locally the neighborhood of current solutions. 
* Diversification: <br/>
 &nbsp; Generate diverse solutions and explore the search space on global scale.

### Implemented meta-heuristic algorithms
  * [Particle Swarm Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization) 
  * [Cuckoo Search](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150GA/homeworks/hw3/_reading7%20Cuckoo%20search.pdf)
  * [Improved Cuckoo Search](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8412665)
    + Improved version of cuckoo search with genetic algorithm.
  * [Conformation Space Annealing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465517303351)
