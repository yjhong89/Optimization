Benchmarks for meta-heuristic optimization algorithms

## Meta-heuristic algorithms
* Intensification: <br/> 
 &nbsp; The ability of improving the existing solutions by exploiting locally the neighborhood of current solutions. 
* Diversification: <br/>
 &nbsp; Generate diverse solutions and explore the search space on global scale.

### Kinds of meta-heuristic algorithms
* [Cuckoo Search](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150GA/homeworks/hw3/_reading7%20Cuckoo%20search.pdf)
