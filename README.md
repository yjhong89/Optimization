Benchmarks for meta-heuristic optimization algorithms

## Meta-heuristic algorithm
* Intensification: <br/> 
 &nbsp; The ability of improving the existing solutions by exploiting locally the neighborhood of current solutions. 
* Diversification: <br/>
 &nbsp; Generate diverse solutions and explore the search space on global scale.
